            <h2>"Kórházak története"</h2>
            <div>
                A kórházak története az ókorban kezdődött a görög, a Római Birodalom és az indiai szubkontinens
                kórházaival, először az ókori Görögország Aszklepiusz templomaiban és az ókori Rómában katonai
                kórházakkal. A 4. század végére következett be a "második orvosi forradalom" a keleti Bizánci
                Birodalomban, amikor Baziliszka, Cesareai Szent Baziliszka alapította meg az első keresztény kórházat.
                A kórházak tovább fejlődtek és fejlődtek a bizánci, középkori európai és iszlám társadalmakban az 5. és
                a 15. század között. Az európai felfedezések kórházakat hoztak Észak-Amerikába, Afrikába és Ázsiába. A
                1123-ban Londonban alapított Szent Bertalan kórház ma is a legrégebben működő kórháznak számít.
                A 19. században Nyugati misszionáriusok hoztak létre kórházakat Kínában és Japánban. A 20. század végén
                és a 21. században kórházakat összefogó hálózatok és állami egészségügyi szervezetek jöttek létre.

                    <p>In ancient Greece, temples dedicated to the healer-god Asclepius, known as Asclepieia (Ancient
                        Greek: Ἀσκληπιεῖα, sing. Asclepieion, Ἀσκληπιεῖον), functioned as centres of medical advice,
                        prognosis, and healing.[9] Asclepeia provided carefully controlled spaces conducive to healing
                        and fulfilled several of the requirements of institutions created for healing.[9] Under his
                        Roman name Æsculapius, he was provided with a temple (291 BCE) on an island in the Tiber in Rome
                        (the Tiber Island), where similar rites were performed.[10].
                        At these shrines, patients would enter a dream-like state of induced sleep known as enkoimesis
                        (ἐγκοίμησις) not unlike anesthesia, in which they either received guidance from the deity in a
                        dream.[11] Asclepeia provided carefully controlled spaces conducive to healing and fulfilled
                        several of the requirements of institutions created for healing.[9] In the Asclepieion of
                        Epidaurus, three large marble boards dated to 350 BCE preserve the names, case histories,
                        complaints, and cures of about 70 patients who came to the temple with a problem and shed it
                        there. Some of the surgical cures listed, such as the opening of an abdominal abscess or the
                        removal of traumatic foreign material, are realistic enough to have taken place, but with the
                        patient in a state of enkoimesis induced with the help of soporific substances such as
                        opium.[11] The worship of Asclepius was adopted by the Romans.

                        The Athenian Navy had a ship named Therapia, and the Roman Navy had a ship named Aesculapius,
                        their names indicating that they may have been hospital ships.</p>

                    <p>The Romans constructed buildings called valetudinaria for the care of sick slaves, gladiators,
                        and soldiers around 100 BCE, and many were identified by later archeology. While their existence
                        is considered proven, there is some doubt as to whether they were as widespread as was once
                        thought, as many were identified only according to the layout of building remains, and not by
                        means of surviving records or finds of medical tools.[15]

                        The declaration of Christianity as an accepted religion in the Roman Empire drove an expansion
                        of the provision of care. Following First Council of Nicaea in 325 CE construction of a hospital
                        in every cathedral town was begun. Among the earliest were those built by the physician Saint
                        Sampson in Constantinople and by Basil of Caesarea in modern-day Turkey towards the end of the
                        4th century. By the beginning of the 5th century, the hospital had already become ubiquitous
                        throughout the Christian east in the Byzantine world,[3] this being a dramatic shift from the
                        pre-Christian era of the Roman Empire where no civilian hospitals existed.[1] Called the
                        "Basilias", the latter resembled a city and included housing for doctors and nurses and separate
                        buildings for various classes of patients.[16] There was a separate section for lepers.[17] Some
                        hospitals maintained libraries and training programs, and doctors compiled their medical and
                        pharmacological studies in manuscripts. Thus in-patient medical care in the sense of what we
                        today consider a hospital, was an invention driven by Christian mercy and Byzantine
                        innovation.[18] Byzantine hospital staff included the Chief Physician (archiatroi), professional
                        nurses (hypourgoi) and the orderlies (hyperetai). By the twelfth century, Constantinople had two
                        well-organized hospitals, staffed by doctors who were both male and female. Facilities included
                        systematic treatment procedures and specialized wards for various diseases</p>

                    <p>The first hospital founded in the Americas was the Hospital San Nicolás de Bari in Santo Domingo,
                        Distrito Nacional Dominican Republic. Fray Nicolás de Ovando, Spanish governor and colonial
                        administrator from 1502 to 1509, authorized its construction on December 29, 1503. This hospital
                        apparently incorporated a church. The first phase of its construction was completed in 1519, and
                        it was rebuilt in 1552.[103] Abandoned in the mid-18th century, the hospital now lies in ruins
                        near the Basilica Cathedral of Santa María la Menor in Santo Domingo.

                        Conquistador Hernán Cortés founded the two earliest hospitals in North America: the Immaculate
                        Conception Hospital and the Saint Lazarus Hospital. The oldest was the Immaculate Conception,
                        now the Hospital de Jesús Nazareno in Mexico City, founded in 1524 to care for the poor.[103]

                        In Quebec, Catholics operated hospitals continuously from the 1640s; they attracted nuns from
                        the provincial elite. Jeanne Mance (1606–73) founded Montreal's city's first hospital, the
                        Hôtel-Dieu de Montréal, in 1645. In 1657 she recruited three sisters of the Religious
                        Hospitallers of St. Joseph, and continued to direct operations of the hospital. The project,
                        begun by the niece of Cardinal de Richelieu was granted a royal charter by King Louis XIII and
                        staffed by a colonial physician, Robert Giffard de Moncel.[104] The General Hospital in Quebec
                        City opened in 1692. They often handled malaria, dysentery, and respiratory sickness.</p>

                    <p>Conflicts and contestations arose between African traditional healers and the colonial healthcare
                        providers over causation and therapeutic approaches to combat particular diseases. Coercive and
                        racialized health interventions also characterized the colonial period, with sanitary
                        segregation measures and criminalization of venereal diseases imposed on Africans.

                        Chapter three examines interventions by the African states in the post-colonial period. It
                        explores the resurgence of old diseases such as malaria, cholera, smallpox, and sleeping
                        sickness and the resurfacing of traditional healing therapies. Traditional healers’ associations
                        suppressed and segregated during the colonial period were now recognized, as evidenced by the
                        reformation of the Association of Traditional Healers in Ghana in 1963. During the battle
                        against HIV/AIDS traditional healers were given fundamental roles to play by the World Health
                        Organization.
                        The second part of the book examines a set of four disease case studies: HIV/AIDS, mental
                        illness, tropical diseases and occupational lung diseases. Chapter four looks at HIV/AIDS. This
                        disease had and continues to have a profound demographic impact on African countries, especially
                        South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Lesotho. These places have the highest mortality and
                        morbidity rates on the continent and among the highest across the across the globe.

                        In chapter five, Lee examines African mental illness in a historical context, something that has
                        generally been neglected by previous scholars. This chapter may be the weakest in the book given
                        just how difficult it is to find historical evidence. Chapter six examines the history of two
                        classic tropical epidemics, namely malaria and sleeping sickness. Lee thoroughly examines their
                        resurgence and deadliness over time and space.

                        The final chapter deals with occupational lung diseases: tuberculosis, silicosis and asbestosis
                        in apartheid South Africa. These ailments were categorized into communicable (tuberculosis) and
                        non-communicable diseases (silicosis and asbestosis). Lee’s examination of how these sicknesses
                        were racialized in the apartheid era is particularly interesting.

                    <p>In ancient Sri Lanka, according to the Mahavansa chronicle from the 6th century CE, King
                        Pandukabhaya constructed hospitals and lying-in-homes after fortifying his capital in
                        Anuradhapura during the 4th century BCE This provides the earliest literary evidence of
                        hospitals, where patients could be housed and treated collectively. The oldest archaeological
                        evidence of a hospital in Asia can be found in the ruins of Mihintale, dating back to the ninth
                        century.[20] Scholars suggest that this may be one of the oldest hospitals in the world.[4][21]

                        King Ashoka is wrongly said by many secondary sources to have founded hospitals ca. 230 BCE.[22]
                        Early medical practices emerged early on in the Indian subcontinent with the practice of
                        Ayurvedic medicine, one of the earliest texts for which survive being the Sushruta Samhita. Some
                        early Buddhist communities established monastic communities with monasteries, and many of these
                        monasteries were centers of learning for medicine. While sick monks within the monastic
                        communities were usually treated in their own cells, some monasteries reserved a room where sick
                        monks could be taken care of.[23] While some of these rooms in Buddhist monasteries may have
                        been open to the public, the majority were closed off to the public and were reserved for
                        treating other monks within the monastery.[24][25] This ideal is reflected in the story of the
                        monk with dysentery.</p>

                    <p >In Europe the medieval concept of Christian care evolved during the sixteenth and seventeenth
                        centuries into a secular one.[93] Theology was the problem. The Protestant reformers rejected
                        the Catholic belief that rich men could gain God's grace through good works – and escape
                        purgatory – by providing endowments to charitable institutions, and that the patients themselves
                        could gain grace through their suffering.[94]

                        After the dissolution of the monasteries in 1540 by King Henry VIII the church abruptly ceased
                        to be the supporter of hospitals, and only by direct petition from the citizens of London, were
                        the hospitals St Bartholomew's, St Thomas's and St Mary of Bethlehem's (Bedlam) endowed directly
                        by the crown.[95] It was at St. Bartholomew that William Harvey conducted his research on the
                        circulatory system in the 17th century, Percivall Pott and John Abernethy developed important
                        principles of modern surgery in the 18th century, and Mrs. Bedford Fenwich worked to advance the
                        nursing profession in the late 19th century.</p>
                    Meanwhile, in Catholic lands such as France and Italy, rich families continued to fund convents and
                    monasteries that provided free health services to the poor. French practices were influenced by a
                    charitable imperative which considered care of the poor and the sick to be a necessary part of
                    Catholic practice. The nursing nuns had little faith in the power of physicians and their medicines
                    alone to cure the sick; more important was providing psychological and physical comfort,
                    nourishment, rest, cleanliness and especially prayer.

                    <p>Traditionally, Chinese medicine relied on small private clinics and individual healers until the
                        middle of the 18th century when missionary hospitals operated by western churches were first
                        established in China. In 1870, the Tung Wah Hospital became the first hospital to offer
                        Traditional Chinese Medicine. After the cultural revolution in 1949, most Chinese hospitals
                        became public.</p>

                    <p>The history of Japanese hospitals is seen to have begun on the 8th century, and Japan’s first
                        modern hospital—
                        which continues to this day—was built in Nagasaki in 1860 by a Dutch naval surgeon, Pompe van
                        Meerdervoort,
                        as a clinical training hospital. However, at the beginning of the 18th century, there was a
                        Yojosho (medical care
                        facility) built in the nation’s capital, Edo, to provide medical care for the poor. This
                        facility was built as the result
                        of one citizen’s recommendation to the Bakufu feudal government.
                        In Japan, with the exception of examples from ancient times when Buddhism was introduced, in the
                        past
                        hospitals were not built for religious reasons. In the second half of the 19th century, the
                        number of hospitals in Japan
                        being used as training grounds for Western medical education gradually grew due to the national
                        government’s
                        decision to control the practice of Chinese herbal medicine and focus instead on Western
                        medicine. Initially the
                        people admitted to these hospitals were wealthy townspeople, but as medical education became
                        more organized,
                        charity patients were also admitted and used for medical education and research.
                        Other hospitals included civic hospitals, which were established in 1868. These hospitals
                        received funding
                        from the Emperor to provide treatment for the poor. In addition, isolation hospitals were
                        established in response
                        to the cholera outbreak that began in 1858. Syphilis hospitals, which conducted syphilis
                        examinations for prostitutes and admitted those who were infected, began to increase in number
                        from the second half of the 1800s.
                        One characteristic of Japanese hospitals is that there are many private hospitals. Indicators of
                        this trend can
                        be observed in the 1870s.</p>

                    <p>The Academy of Gondishapur was a hospital and medical training center at Gundeshapur in Persia.
                The city of Gundeshapur was founded in 271 CE by the Sassanid king Shapur I. It was one of the major
                cities in Khuzestan province of the Persian empire, in Iran. A large percentage of the population were
                Syriacs, most of whom were Christians. Under the rule of Khusraw I, refuge was granted to Greek
                Nestorian Christian philosophers including the scholars of the Persian School of Edessa (Urfa) (also
                called the Academy of Athens), a Christian theological and medical university. These scholars made their
                way to Gundeshapur in 529 following the closing of the academy by Emperor Justinian. They were engaged
                in medical sciences and initiated the first translation projects of medical texts.[60] The arrival of
                these medical practitioners from Edessa marks the beginning of the hospital and medical centre at
                Gundeshapur.[33] It included a medical school and hospital (bimaristan), a pharmacology laboratory, a
                translation house, a library and an observatory.[61] Indian doctors also contributed to the school at
                Gundeshapur, most notably the medical researcher Mankah. Later after Islamic invasion, the writings of
                Mankah and of the Indian doctor Susruta were translated into Arabic at Baghdad's House of Wisdom.
